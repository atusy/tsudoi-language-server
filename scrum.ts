An unlabelled claim in a handback reads as REASONED under their own default, and putting it in a criterion converted it to ESTABLISHED without measurement. MEASURED: no fixture and no example imports that subpath at all -- all 24 of their protocol imports are the BARE specifier.

SHARPENED AT SPRINT 15, and it does not over-delete useful redundancy: A CONTROL THAT CAN NEVER BE THE FIRST THING TO FAIL IS NOT A CONTROL -- ask whether something else would have failed first. Two tests reddening on one bug is fine; a test that reddens only after another already has adds nothing. IT READS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, added at Sprint 16 with the guard that stops it becoming a licence: one that WOULD be first to fail is worth ADDING when the existing detection is real but ARRIVES WITHOUT NAMING ITS CAUSE.
