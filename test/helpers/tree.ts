/**
 * A throwaway directory tree, WITH NO DOTFILES IN IT.
 *
 * Hidden-entry behaviour is UNRULED -- the stakeholder did not ask -- and a
 * fixture that happened to contain one would pin a decision nobody made. The
 * same rule is why nothing here is named `./x` or `../x`.
 *
 * realpathSync is not cosmetic: on macOS the system temp directory lives under
 * /var, which IS a symlink to /private/var, and a child process started with
 * cwd there reports the resolved path. Comparing the two spellings is a
 * failure that looks like a logic error and is not one.
