// THE PUBLISHED TYPE SURFACE. package.json maps `@atusy/tsudoi/types` here, and
// this is the only path a config author outside the repo can reach by bare
// specifier, so every exported name below is public API and renaming one breaks
// configs we cannot see.
//
// What ships is the COMPILED dist/types.d.ts, not this file: since sprint 10 the
// package publishes dist/ alone, so that a deno user can run the CLI from
// node_modules at all. The shape of that surface and the reason for every arm of
// the exports map are asserted in test/package-shape.test.ts, which is where a
// decision about a file that cannot carry comments lives.

   * The workspace folders the client sent at `initialize`, or an EMPTY LIST
   * when it sent none.
   *
   * Absence is a state a config author must be able to SEE: it is never
   * defaulted to the working directory, to `/`, or to anything else this
   * process could invent. An empty list means the editor opened no workspace,
   * and answering from a root nobody named is the failure this shape refuses.
   *
   * Both of the protocol's absent states -- the field omitted and the field
   * sent as null -- arrive here as the same empty list, so a config author
   * never has to know there were two.
   *
   * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, stated at the type because this is where someone
   * would otherwise assume otherwise: it is a SNAPSHOT of `initialize` and it
   * DOES NOT TRACK CHANGES. LSP has `workspace/didChangeWorkspaceFolders`, a
   * user really can add or remove a folder mid-session, and tsudoi does not
   * handle that notification -- so after such a change this list is what the
   * session STARTED with, not what the editor considers current. MEASURED: the
   * notification arrives whether or not a server advertises for it, so this is
   * a thing tsudoi currently IGNORES rather than one it opts out of.
   *
   * The name is deliberately not `initialWorkspaceFolders`. That would be
   * accurate today and WRONG the moment tracking lands, and every exported
   * name here is public API -- renaming one breaks configs nobody can see.
